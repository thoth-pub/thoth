## Merge and implementation rules

These ADRs may be committed as part of the engineering-control foundation while `PROPOSED`.

No implementation task may rely on them until:

1. the CTO explicitly approves the relevant decision;
2. the ADR status is changed to `APPROVED`;
3. the approval date and approver are recorded;
4. the changed ADR receives independent review;
5. the approved version is merged into `develop`.

## Approval sequence

Approve `ADR-0001` before:

- Publisher Services `BE-01`;
- metrics entitlement implementation;
- protected metrics serving;
- OAI package-gating implementation.

Approve `ADR-0002` before:

- Publisher Services `BE-02`;
- Thoth Metrics platform-registry implementation;
- any shared platform abstraction or mapping.

# Thoth Metrics Contract Register

Status: ACTIVE DESIGN REGISTER
Owner: Thoth Metrics programme

## 1. Normalized observation

Version:

```text
thoth-normalized-metrics/1
```

Required: source account, platform, measure, work DOI, period start/end, grain, value and methodology version. Optional: publication ISBN/type, country, ROR, source record and row.

Owner: `thoth`. Producer: `thoth-sphinx`.

Sphinx constructs batches; Thoth resolves codes and identifiers. Contract changes require versioning or explicit compatibility review.

## 2. Registry and administration

Thoth owns platform, measure, platform-measure, source account, publisher approval and entitlement operations. Codes are stable, mutations are protected, credentials never enter configuration JSON, and generated clients must be refreshed.

### 2.1 Delivered administration surface (`MET-WP1-12`)

`MET-WP1-12` delivers the first protected slice of this contract: administration
of exactly `metric_platform`, `metric_measure` and `metric_platform_measure`.

Operations, all **SUPERUSER only** and all authorized before any
mutation-specific database read, row lock or write:

```graphql
createMetricPlatform(data: NewMetricPlatform!): MetricPlatform!
updateMetricPlatform(data: PatchMetricPlatform!): MetricPlatform!

createMetricMeasure(data: NewMetricMeasure!): MetricMeasure!
updateMetricMeasure(data: PatchMetricMeasure!): MetricMeasure!

createMetricPlatformMeasure(data: NewMetricPlatformMeasure!): MetricPlatformMeasure!
updateMetricPlatformMeasure(data: PatchMetricPlatformMeasure!): MetricPlatformMeasure!

metricPlatformByCode(code: String!): MetricPlatform!
metricMeasureByCode(code: String!): MetricMeasure!
metricPlatformMeasureByCodes(platformCode: String!, measureCode: String!): MetricPlatformMeasure!
```

Contract properties consumers may rely on:

- **Stable code identity.** Every operation addresses a row by its stable
  `code`, and a mapping by its `(platformCode, measureCode)` pair. No mutation
  requires the caller to know a database-generated UUID.
- **Exact `TEXT` matching.** Codes are stored as supplied and compared literally.
  There is no trimming, case folding, `ILIKE`, Unicode normalization, whitespace
  normalization or aliasing at any entry point, so case and whitespace variants
  are distinct codes. Any future normalization is a separately reviewed
  schema/API change.
- **Replacement, not patch.** A `Patch...` input carries the complete approved
  mutable field set. For a nullable mutable field, omission and explicit `null`
  both store SQL `NULL`; retaining a value requires sending it.
- **Immutability.** A platform's `code` and `ownershipClass`, a measure's `code`,
  `category`, `unit`, `allowNegative`, `additiveAcrossTime` and
  `additiveAcrossWorks`, and a mapping's platform/measure identity cannot be
  changed and are absent from the patch inputs.
- **No delete.** Retirement is `enabled = false`, an ordinary audited update.
- **Audited and atomic.** Every committed create/update writes the canonical row
  and exactly one `metric_registry_history` row in one transaction, recording the
  authenticated actor and the exact persisted before/after state. Rejected,
  unauthorized, failed and genuine no-op requests write neither, and a no-op
  moves no canonical timestamp. The audit table is exposed nowhere in the schema.
- **Serialized last-write-wins.** Each update takes exactly one canonical-row
  `FOR UPDATE` lock. There is no optimistic-concurrency token: unlike publisher
  service configuration, no single coherent version token spans these three
  entities, and `metric_platform_measure` deliberately carries no timestamp.
- **Sanitized failures.** PostgreSQL remains authoritative for code uniqueness,
  pair uniqueness, foreign keys, nonblank CHECKs and the `supported_grains`
  CHECK. Reachable violations return bounded messages exposing no PostgreSQL
  text, constraint name, SQL, driver diagnostic or connection detail.

Downstream impact: the change is **strictly additive** — three object types, six
inputs, four additive enum exposures, six mutations and three queries, with no
existing type, field, nullability, enum variant or authorization behaviour
changed. No consumer requires a change to keep working; a consumer that wants to
administer the registry refreshes its generated client against the merged
contract.

Still deferred to separately specified work: publisher-platform approval
administration, source/source-account/checkpoint administration, the
service/dashboard registry list queries `metricPlatforms` and `metricMeasures`,
any delete or bulk operation, any audit-history query, and any real platform,
platform-measure, source, source-account or OPERAS seed.

## 3. Internal ingestion

Thoth owns bounded claim/checkpoint/import/batch/rollup/export/reconciliation operations consumed by Sphinx.

Required: least privilege, leases, stale-token rejection, idempotency, bounded batches, sanitized errors, exact row classifications and fail-closed behavior.

## 4. Dashboard/widget

Thoth owns entity metrics, dashboard/widget operations and registry queries.

Required response concerns: distinct measure totals, timeline, breakdowns, coverage, freshness, watermark, warnings, partial state, BigInt strings and deterministic pagination.

Semantics: OR within lists, AND between dimensions, exclusive end date, bounded ranges and filtering before pagination.

## 5. Publisher import

Flow: initialize private upload, direct browser upload, complete/queue, Sphinx claim/normalize, Thoth validate/commit, Sphinx complete, app reads result.

Publisher derives from authentication; object keys are server-selected; MIME/size/checksum/decompression are bounded; managed platforms are prohibited.

## 6. OPERAS

Thoth owns canonical export claims and ledgers. Sphinx projects/delivers. Configuration includes platform/measure mapping, event URI, measure URI, uploader URI, enabled state and finalization. Drivers never construct OPERAS payloads.

## 7. Authentication (service roles)

The shared machine-role architecture is decided:
[`ADR-0008`](../engineering/decisions/ADR-0008-machine-roles-and-durable-job-primitives.md)
(`APPROVED`, repository-authoritative) establishes dedicated, least-privilege,
**domain-specific** machine-role conventions — no generic catch-all service
role, an explicit policy guard and authorization matrix per machine role, and
no `SUPERUSER` shortcut for machine services.

### 7.1 Delivered minimum service-role contract (`MET-WP5-01`)

`MET-WP5-01` (issue #907) fixes the two MOM-1 Metrics service roles as
repository-authoritative contract. Both are **unscoped** ZITADEL project roles
implemented in the central policy module (`thoth-api/src/policy.rs`) as
`Role::MetricsIngestService` and `Role::MetricsReadService`, with the
predicates `UserAccess::is_metrics_ingest_service()` /
`UserAccess::is_metrics_read_service()` and the guards
`PolicyContext::require_metrics_ingest_service()` /
`PolicyContext::require_metrics_read_service()`, and declared (never granted)
by the `zitadel setup` bootstrap command.

| Role code | Purpose | Complete MOM-1 protected operation set | Consuming slice |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `METRICS_INGEST_SERVICE` | Sphinx orchestration caller for managed-source ingestion | `claimMetricSourceUnits`, `updateMetricSourceCheckpoint`, `beginMetricImport`, `ingestMetricBatch`, `completeMetricImport`, `claimMetricRollupDeltas`, `completeMetricRollupDeltas` | `MET-WP2-02` (ingestion, checkpoint and import lifecycle), `MET-WP4-01` (rollup-delta application) |
| `METRICS_READ_SERVICE` | Thoth-owned server-side Metrics query clients | `metricDashboard`, `metricMeasures`, `metricPlatforms` | `MET-WP4-02` |

Invariants (each has a colocated test in the policy module):

1. Each role is satisfied only by the presence of its exact role key. There is
   no role inheritance: `SUPERUSER` does not satisfy either guard,
   `DISSEMINATION_WORKER` does not satisfy either guard, and neither Metrics
   role satisfies the other or any existing guard.
2. Neither role confers publisher scope, any `PublisherPermissions`, or any
   package/capability entitlement. Both are excluded from
   `publisher_org_ids()`, so a machine-only account never appears to hold
   publisher organisations.
3. `METRICS_READ_SERVICE` never supplies publisher entitlement for the data it
   may serve (for example `METRICS_DASHBOARD`); that remains a separate
   ADR-0001 check performed by the consuming operation.
4. The operation sets above are complete for MOM-1. Any addition, any other
   role code (including the sketched `METRICS_SYNC_SERVICE`, which remains a
   deferred proposal only) and any role composition requires its own approved
   specification.
5. None of the listed operations exists in this slice. `MET-WP5-01` defines the
   roles and guards only; the operations are delivered, and wired to these
   guards, by the consuming slices under their own authorization.

Credential, provisioning, grant and rotation arrangements remain outside this
register and outside the repository: no live ZITADEL role is created or
granted by the delivery of this contract.

Consumers must not substitute superuser: `SUPERUSER` is not a machine-service
shortcut.

## 8. Cross-repository gate

Record exact producer commit/preview, generated types, contract fixtures, compatibility, merge order, non-production credentials and independent rollback before final review.

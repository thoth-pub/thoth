# Thoth Metrics Contract Register

Status: ACTIVE DESIGN REGISTER
Owner: Thoth Metrics programme

## 1. Normalized observation

Version:

```text
thoth-normalized-metrics/1
```

Required: source account, platform, measure, work DOI, period start/end, grain, value and methodology version. Optional: publication ISBN/type, country, ROR, source record and row.

Owner: `thoth`. Producer: `thoth-sphinx`.

Sphinx constructs batches; Thoth resolves codes and identifiers. Contract changes require versioning or explicit compatibility review.

## 2. Registry and administration

Thoth owns platform, measure, platform-measure, source account, publisher approval and entitlement operations. Codes are stable, mutations are protected, credentials never enter configuration JSON, and generated clients must be refreshed.

### 2.1 Delivered administration surface (`MET-WP1-12`)

`MET-WP1-12` delivers the first protected slice of this contract: administration
of exactly `metric_platform`, `metric_measure` and `metric_platform_measure`.

Operations, all **SUPERUSER only** and all authorized before any
mutation-specific database read, row lock or write:

```graphql
createMetricPlatform(data: NewMetricPlatform!): MetricPlatform!
updateMetricPlatform(data: PatchMetricPlatform!): MetricPlatform!

createMetricMeasure(data: NewMetricMeasure!): MetricMeasure!
updateMetricMeasure(data: PatchMetricMeasure!): MetricMeasure!

createMetricPlatformMeasure(data: NewMetricPlatformMeasure!): MetricPlatformMeasure!
updateMetricPlatformMeasure(data: PatchMetricPlatformMeasure!): MetricPlatformMeasure!

metricPlatformByCode(code: String!): MetricPlatform!
metricMeasureByCode(code: String!): MetricMeasure!
metricPlatformMeasureByCodes(platformCode: String!, measureCode: String!): MetricPlatformMeasure!
```

Contract properties consumers may rely on:

- **Stable code identity.** Every operation addresses a row by its stable
  `code`, and a mapping by its `(platformCode, measureCode)` pair. No mutation
  requires the caller to know a database-generated UUID.
- **Exact `TEXT` matching.** Codes are stored as supplied and compared literally.
  There is no trimming, case folding, `ILIKE`, Unicode normalization, whitespace
  normalization or aliasing at any entry point, so case and whitespace variants
  are distinct codes. Any future normalization is a separately reviewed
  schema/API change.
- **Replacement, not patch.** A `Patch...` input carries the complete approved
  mutable field set. For a nullable mutable field, omission and explicit `null`
  both store SQL `NULL`; retaining a value requires sending it.
- **Immutability.** A platform's `code` and `ownershipClass`, a measure's `code`,
  `category`, `unit`, `allowNegative`, `additiveAcrossTime` and
  `additiveAcrossWorks`, and a mapping's platform/measure identity cannot be
  changed and are absent from the patch inputs.
- **No delete.** Retirement is `enabled = false`, an ordinary audited update.
- **Audited and atomic.** Every committed create/update writes the canonical row
  and exactly one `metric_registry_history` row in one transaction, recording the
  authenticated actor and the exact persisted before/after state. Rejected,
  unauthorized, failed and genuine no-op requests write neither, and a no-op
  moves no canonical timestamp. The audit table is exposed nowhere in the schema.
- **Serialized last-write-wins.** Each update takes exactly one canonical-row
  `FOR UPDATE` lock. There is no optimistic-concurrency token: unlike publisher
  service configuration, no single coherent version token spans these three
  entities, and `metric_platform_measure` deliberately carries no timestamp.
- **Sanitized failures.** PostgreSQL remains authoritative for code uniqueness,
  pair uniqueness, foreign keys, nonblank CHECKs and the `supported_grains`
  CHECK. Reachable violations return bounded messages exposing no PostgreSQL
  text, constraint name, SQL, driver diagnostic or connection detail.

Downstream impact: the change is **strictly additive** — three object types, six
inputs, four additive enum exposures, six mutations and three queries, with no
existing type, field, nullability, enum variant or authorization behaviour
changed. No consumer requires a change to keep working; a consumer that wants to
administer the registry refreshes its generated client against the merged
contract.

Still deferred to separately specified work: publisher-platform approval
administration, source/source-account/checkpoint administration, the
service/dashboard registry list queries `metricPlatforms` and `metricMeasures`,
any delete or bulk operation, any audit-history query, and any real platform,
platform-measure, source, source-account or OPERAS seed.

## 3. Internal ingestion

Thoth owns bounded claim/checkpoint/import/batch/rollup/export/reconciliation operations consumed by Sphinx.

Required: least privilege, leases, stale-token rejection, idempotency, bounded batches, sanitized errors, exact row classifications and fail-closed behavior.

## 4. Dashboard/widget

Thoth owns entity metrics, dashboard/widget operations and registry queries.

Required response concerns: distinct measure totals, timeline, breakdowns, coverage, freshness, watermark, warnings, partial state, BigInt strings and deterministic pagination.

Semantics: OR within lists, AND between dimensions, exclusive end date, bounded ranges and filtering before pagination.

## 5. Publisher import

Flow: initialize private upload, direct browser upload, complete/queue, Sphinx claim/normalize, Thoth validate/commit, Sphinx complete, app reads result.

Publisher derives from authentication; object keys are server-selected; MIME/size/checksum/decompression are bounded; managed platforms are prohibited.

## 6. OPERAS

Thoth owns canonical export claims and ledgers. Sphinx projects/delivers. Configuration includes platform/measure mapping, event URI, measure URI, uploader URI, enabled state and finalization. Drivers never construct OPERAS payloads.

## 7. Authentication (service roles)

The shared machine-role architecture is decided:
[`ADR-0008`](../engineering/decisions/ADR-0008-machine-roles-and-durable-job-primitives.md)
(`APPROVED`, repository-authoritative) establishes dedicated, least-privilege,
**domain-specific** machine-role conventions — no generic catch-all service
role, an explicit policy guard and authorization matrix per machine role, and
no `SUPERUSER` shortcut for machine services.

Within that convention, the following remain **unapproved** and are WP5-owned
bounded decisions under WP5's own approved specification:

- exact Metrics role codes — the sketched candidates

  ```text
  METRICS_READ_SERVICE
  METRICS_INGEST_SERVICE
  METRICS_SYNC_SERVICE
  ```

  remain proposals only and are not promoted by `ADR-0008` or by this
  register;
- the exact permissions/operation matrix per role;
- credential, provisioning and rotation arrangements.

Consumers must not substitute superuser: `SUPERUSER` is not a machine-service
shortcut.

## 8. Cross-repository gate

Record exact producer commit/preview, generated types, contract fixtures, compatibility, merge order, non-production credentials and independent rollback before final review.

# Publisher Services Task Status

Status: ACTIVE TRACKER
Programme owner: CTO
Master issue: [#765](https://github.com/thoth-pub/thoth/issues/765)
Approved design: [private Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kr2Ft0Y4pxgcXGyFAKs_wfFx4I0jlxEvaceswE5Dus8/edit), Drive revision `3`
Last updated: 2026-07-29

## 1. Control rule

Publisher Services follows the approved design's one-task/one-branch/one-PR workflow. It does not use a long-lived programme integration branch.

No task moves to `READY` without an approved specification, architecture dependencies, verified repository/base/target, branch-readiness completion or CTO exception, named implementation/review models, tests, migration, rollout and rollback.

`TBD` is missing work, not implicit approval.

## 3. Branch rule

Recommended task names follow the design, for example:

```text
feature/publisher-services/adr-01
feature/publisher-services/be-01
feature/publisher-services/dis-01
```

Each branch starts from the repository's verified development branch and targets that branch directly. Merge and delete it after independent approval. There is no parent `feature/publisher-services` branch.

## 4. Next actions

1. The
   [`BE-01` specification](../engineering/ai-delivery/tasks/BE-01.md) becomes
   repository-authoritative when specification
   [PR #774](https://github.com/thoth-pub/thoth/pull/774) is independently
   approved and merged; BE-01 remains `BLOCKED`.
2. `THOTH-DB-CTRL-01` must then establish the shared Diesel procedure through
   its own independent approval and merge.
3. After that shared control passes, a separate control update may move BE-01
   from `BLOCKED` to `READY`.
4. Only then may `feature/publisher-services/be-01` be created from the freshly
   verified then-current `develop`, with the exact base recorded before any
   implementation edit.
5. ADR-01 specification and final distribution-platform inventory work may
   proceed separately under their own approval gates.
6. BE-01-SPEC unlocks no BE-01 implementation edit, BE-02, BE-03, OAI-PMH,
   deployment, release or
   production work; all licence, migration, app, dissemination and operational
   tasks remain blocked.
